#Trains

https://lordsorcerer.github.io/trains/

A mock train scheduler program.  The 'administrator' is able to view the calculated arrival times for trains, add new trains and delete trains from the list.  All trains are stored on a Firebase database.

Disclaimer: None of these trains are real.  The admin of this Github repo take no responsibility for time and money wasted attempting to purchase tickets for and/or boarding said trains.  As a note, contact me if you somehow successfully do so.  I will be impressed!
